# Exploratory Data Analysis on an Airbnb Dataset

In 2015, the Paris City Council implemented restrictions on rentals through Airbnb to address issues related to housing and tourism, aiming to regulate the supply from residents to tourists. These restrictions include mandatory registration by the owners, a limit on the number of days per year a property can be rented, and authorization for the rental of secondary residences. Inspections are conducted to ensure hosts comply with the restrictions, and failure to do so can result in hefty fines of up to 50,000 Euros.

We will analyze the current situation of property rentals through Airbnb in Paris and the effect that the aforementioned restrictions have had on the supply of accommodations.
